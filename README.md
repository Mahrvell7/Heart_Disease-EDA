## Insights from EDA

    ## Heart Disease by Gender distribution(pie chart)
The larger section, colored in blue, represents 84.8% and is labeled with “No”. This means that of the 4200+ responses in this survey, 84.8% had not experienced a heart disease episode.
The smaller section, colored in orange, represents 15.2% and is labeled with “Yes”. 15.2% of the respondents had experienced a heart disease episode.
In summary, the pie chart suggests that a majority of responses in the studied dataset had not experienced a heart disease episode, leading to a relatively small sample size of those who had experienced a heart disease episode.

## Occurrence of heart disease by Gender
In summary, this EDA suggests that a significant number of both genders have not experienced a heart stroke, while a smaller proportion has. The number of females who haven’t experienced a heart stroke is slightly higher than males. In contrast, the number of males who have experienced a heart stroke is slightly higher than females.
